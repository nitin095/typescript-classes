## Problem Statement
As a solution to this problem statement, you are supposed to create Classes for
following scenarios, create the necessary properties, constructor and methods and then
demonstrate the use of the class by creating an object of the same and printing
messages in console of the website as output.

### 1) Youtube Video Class 
Go to youtube.com and look at a video page. Now, try and
create a class with properties(for example: video title) and methods(for example :
getNumberofViews) with proper types using typescript. Think of as many properties and
methods as you can imagine and write all of them.

### 2) Social Profile Class 
Go to facebook.com profile page, about section. Now try and
create a class with properties (like birthday) and methods(like getAge()) with proper
types using typescript. Think of as many properties and methods as you can imagine
and write all of them.

Here are some important points -
  1) In some cases, if you come across a method name (for example:
  getRelatedVideos() in case of youtube class) where you donâ€™t know the
  implementation. You can just leave it to method declaration. Just declare the
  name and in implementation, just print a console message. The idea is to push
  your imagination as much as possible, rather than struggling with trivial JS
  implementation.
  2) You are supposed to submit the code with full folders. Just like taught in the
  videos i.e your folder must contain the HTML file, TS file and compiled JS file as
  well. Upload it all on a github repository.
